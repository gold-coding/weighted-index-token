Explanation
All functions are similar to previous implemenation.
For security ERC20Permit contract is added.

The permit function in the ERC-20 standard is an addition that comes from the EIP-2612 proposal, which extends the ERC-20 token standard to include permissionless token approvals using signatures. This feature allows users to approve a spender to transfer tokens on their behalf without requiring an on-chain transaction from the token holder themselves. Instead, the token holder signs a message containing the approval information, and the spender or a third party submits this signature to the blockchain.

function permit(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external;

Parameters
owner: The address of the token holder giving the approval.
spender: The address which is being authorized to spend the tokens.
value: The number of tokens the spender is allowed to spend.
deadline: A timestamp until which the permit is valid. This helps in preventing replay attacks.
v, r, s: Components of the ECDSA signature. These values are generated when the token holder signs a set of data that includes the spender, the value, and a nonce.


-Signing the Data: The token owner signs a message that includes the spenderâ€™s address, the amount of tokens to be approved, a nonce (to prevent replay attacks), and the deadline. This signature is made according to EIP-712, which allows for readable signing messages.
-Submitting the Signature: A user (can be the spender or another party) calls the permit function with the owner's address, spender's address, value, deadline, and the signature (v, r, s).
-Validation: The contract then validates the signature, checks that the nonce is correct, and that the current time is before the deadline.
-Approval: If all checks pass, the contract updates the allowance mapping as if a regular approve call was made, enabling the spender to use the transferFrom method up to the allowed amount.

This method enhances user experience by reducing the need for multiple transactions and potentially lowering transaction fees, making interactions smoother in decentralized environments.
